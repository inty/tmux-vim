* Only the original pane has access to the TVIM and TDIR variables, it would be
  nice to have them shared within all panes in a window, so that tvim just works
  across all panes
  - some kind of code hook for new panes which sets TVIM and TDIR?
  - tmux managed key/value pair store per windows?
  - bash function which splits the window and then sends keystrokes across?
